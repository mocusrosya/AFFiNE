Lord Of The Rings: Battle For Middle Earth 2 (BFME2) is a popular real-time strategy game based on the fantasy world of Tolkien. However, if you want to play it on your Mac computer, you may encounter some problems. One of them is that the game requires a CD to run, which can be inconvenient or impossible for some users. Fortunately, there is a way to play BFME2 on Mac without CD, by using a no-cd patch or crack. Here are the steps to do it:
 
1. Download the game. You can either download a vanilla BFME2 ISO file from [Mirror #1](https://www.mediafire.com/file/4heo0ipvahha...fMe_II.iso/file) or [Mirror #2](https://mega.nz/file/lrx0kbpK#tqaPysq6ILAo0...Lp3pzK37sofLeFE), which comes with all the game features and supports all available languages, but weighs 4GB and requires a random generated serial key[^1^]; or you can download BFME2 Special Edition from [this link](http://forshire.blogspot.com/p/download-bfme-ii.html), which is easier and faster to install, weighs only 2GB, doesn't need mounting or serial key, but has some game features and assets deleted, such as non-English support files or World-builder[^2^].
2. Install the game. If you downloaded the vanilla BFME2 ISO file, you need to extract it with a compressor app like WinRAR or 7zip, then run the "setup.exe" file and proceed with the installation. You also need to copy a key number from [this key generator](https://mega.nz/file/Nuxy2CZD#miSm0t4BLwTmO...QQ0I9tFfq1bsd5g) for the installation[^2^]. If you downloaded BFME2 Special Edition, you just need to run the installer and follow the instructions.
3. Install the Patch Switcher. Download GameReplays's Latest BFME2 1.09 version & Switcher from [Mirror #1](https://mega.nz/file/JrhCAb7A#h9xPAmUUKLZSp...ZS2LmN77LLK0Gvg) or [Mirror #2](https://www.mediafire.com/file/pdkpsk3yfzsc...ler%20%284%29.rar/file). This will allow you to switch between different patches of the game, including 1.06 and 1.09, which have no-cd cracks integrated[^2^]. If you have a previous switcher, ensure you are in patch 1.06, then uninstall old switcher, then install the new one.
4. Fix the game for Mac. If your game crashes in any version, run [this fixer](https://www.moddb.com/games/battle-for-midd...-startup-fixxer) and click fix BFME2[^2^]. If your game still crashes on loading screen, follow [these instructions](https://www.gamereplays.org/community/index.php?showtopic=1000430&st=120&#entry10377279) to edit your options.ini file.
5. Install a multiplayer platform. If you want to play online with other players, you need to install Gameranger, the most popular multiplayer platform for BFME2. Download it from [this link](https://www.gameranger.com/download/) and create an account. Then just host or join a game in BFME2 and play[^2^]. If you don't understand Gameranger, here's [a guide](https://www.gamereplays.org/battleformiddle...ameranger-guide).
6. Enjoy the game! You can now play BFME2 on your Mac
