    <keyboard version="1">
    <!--
    This is the default keyboard mapping for VirtualDJ 8
    You can edit this file with any text editor
    You can also create your own keyboard mapping files and place them in the same folder
    -->
    <!--
    The syntax for each key mapping is:
    <key action="action_name" param="parameter" />
    The action name is the name of the function or command you want to assign to the key
    The parameter is an optional value that modifies the action
    You can find a list of all available actions and parameters in the VirtualDJ manual or online wiki
    -->
    <!--
    The key name is the name of the key on your keyboard
    You can use any key name that is recognized by your operating system
    You can also use modifiers such as shift, ctrl, alt, cmd (Mac only), or fn (laptop only)
    You can combine multiple modifiers with a plus sign (+)
    For example: shift+ctrl+a means press shift, ctrl, and a at the same time
